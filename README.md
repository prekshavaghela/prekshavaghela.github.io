Preksha Vaghela's personal website!!! Learn more about me and what I've been doing to progress in computer engineering!! 

work from may 20th:
I simply wrote out my resume, still need to add formatting and background and some other cool features but I wanted to have some of my content down before I started working on the design.
I made a navigation bar using bootstrap, but I still need to properly link everything together with the resume. I used it as an outline for everything that I should include on my website currently.
